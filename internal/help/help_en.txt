Hello Dear User,

I am very happy to assist you!

To use the bot, you can select the source and target languages for your messages in the translation
settings. This allows you to send messages in your desired language in any chat or group you are
part of.

After configuring the settings, enter the chat or group you want to use. Then, by typing the bot's
username as “ @TranslateGoBot “ followed by a space and your desired text, wait for a few
seconds (about 2 to 3 seconds). The " Translate " option will appear above the typing area.
Click on it, and the bot will automatically translate your text and
send it in the target language.

To change the bot's menu language, you can go to the settings section, select the language option,
and choose one of the available languages for the bot's menu.
